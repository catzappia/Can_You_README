# Can_You_README
An application to generate a high-quality README that meets githubs' professional criteria. 

## Description

- I find READMEs to be difficult to write from scratch. Starting out, I had no idea what I was supposed to include other than a few lines explaining what the repository was for and what it was meant to accomplish. 
-  I know for a fact that there are other developers like me--either just starting out or trying to become more comfortable and familiar with github in general--that could use a README generator to help streamline their repository creation. Not to mention, it provides one less thing to stress over during the coding process! 
- I learned how fun javascript, node, and inquirer could be! Not to mention the seemingly endless uses for these programs. Perhaps I'll dabble with them more in the (not-so-distant) future.
